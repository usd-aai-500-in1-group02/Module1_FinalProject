CALIBRATED STROKE PREDICTION MODEL
===================================

Best Calibration Method: Isotonic
Calibration Improvement: ECE reduced from 0.3961 to 0.0021

Usage:
------
import joblib
calibrated_model = joblib.load('saved_model/stroke_prediction_calibrated.pkl')

# Make calibrated predictions
probabilities = calibrated_model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]

These probabilities are now well-calibrated for clinical use!

Performance:
-----------
Original ECE: 0.3961
Calibrated ECE: 0.0021
ROC-AUC maintained: 0.8093

Clinical Interpretation:
-----------------------
- Probabilities now accurately reflect true stroke risk
- Safe to use percentages for clinical decision-making
- Improved reliability for risk communication to patients
