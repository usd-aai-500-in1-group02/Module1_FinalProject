According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. The Stroke Prediction Dataset by Fedesoriano on Kaggle is designed to aid in predicting the likelihood of a stroke in patients based on various health and demographic factors. It comprises 11 clinical attributes, including gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and stroke occurrence. This dataset is valuable for developing machine learning models aimed at early stroke detection and prevention.
